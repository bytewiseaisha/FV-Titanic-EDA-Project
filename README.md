# Titanic EDA Project
This repository contains a beginner-friendly data science project that explores the Titanic dataset.

## Problem Statement
Analyze the Titanic dataset (`Titanic.csv`) to extract insights using tools like Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.  

## Tasks:
1. Use Pandas to read the dataset.  
2. Calculate the total age, mean age, median age, and modal age.  
3. Identify missing values and outliers in the dataset.  
4. Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
   - Draw a histogram to visualize the number of males and females.  
5. Determine:  
   - The total number of males and females who survived and did not survive.  
6. Calculate the average age of male and female survivors.  

## Tools Required 
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- Matplotlib
